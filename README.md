# Car Price Prediction with Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the **price** of cars based on various features, such as the **make**, **model**, **year**, **mileage**, and **condition**. By analyzing these factors and their impact on car prices, we can build a predictive model to estimate the value of a car based on its attributes.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset generated to simulate real-world car price variability. It contains information on car prices and associated features, offering a solid foundation for data analysis and regression modeling.

### Dataset Summary
The dataset contains multiple features related to car characteristics, which are detailed below:

- **Make**: The brand or manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Ford).
- **Model**: The specific model of the car (e.g., Camry, Civic, F-150).
- **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Mileage**: The total mileage (in miles) of the car.
- **Condition**: The condition of the car, categorized as Excellent, Good, or Fair.
- **Price**: The target variable, representing the price of the car.

### Dataset Size
The dataset consists of several rows, each representing a unique car entry. Each row includes both **numerical** and **categorical** attributes.

### Data Types
- **Numerical**: Year, Mileage, Price.
- **Categorical**: Make, Model, Condition.

### Missing Values
The dataset has no missing values, ensuring smooth analysis without the need for imputation or handling missing data.

### Data Source
The dataset was synthetically generated using a Python script designed to simulate realistic car prices based on random values and predefined factors. This synthetic data is specifically structured for educational purposes in car price prediction.

## Purpose and Objectives
This project is designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The main objectives include:
1. Conducting exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and relationships.
2. Building and evaluating regression models to predict car prices based on available features.
3. Implementing feature engineering techniques for improved model performance.

## Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling data types, encoding categorical variables, and checking data consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting distributions, correlations, and feature impacts on car prices.
- **Regression Modeling**: Using models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and others to predict car prices.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Analyzing model performance using metrics like RÂ², RMSE, and MAE.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into factors affecting car prices and demonstrates the development of a regression model to predict car prices. Through EDA and predictive modeling, this dataset allows us to explore the relationships between car features and their market value.
